The error message you are seeing suggests that TypeScript is expecting an array of strings (string[]), but you are passing an array of objects with the structure { pre: string; name: string; }. This mismatch is causing the type error.

To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that the type of the wards array matches what your .map() function expects. If wards is supposed to be an array of objects with pre and name properties, you need to specify its type correctly.

Here's an updated version of your code with type annotation for the wards array:

A type Ward is defined to represent each item in the wards array.
The wards array is explicitly declared as an array of Ward objects.
The .map() function is used as before, but now TypeScript knows that each item in wards is a Ward object.
Make sure that the actual data source for wards matches this structure, and adjust the type definition if needed based on your actual data.

To refactor the RoomService class for cleanliness and readability, you can follow these steps:

Organize Imports and Dependencies: Group related imports and remove any unused imports.
Error Handling: Standardize error messages and handling.
Method Organization: Group similar methods together and ensure consistent method signatures.
Code Comments: Add comments to clarify the purpose of complex code blocks.
Refactor Large Methods: Break down large methods into smaller, more manageable functions.
Consistent Naming Conventions: Ensure that variable and method names follow a consistent naming convention.
Use Async/Await Consistently: Ensure consistency in using async/await.
Optimize Code: Look for opportunities to simplify and optimize the code.
Here's a refactored version of your RoomService class:

```
const ArgumentError = require("../../../exception/ArgumentError");
const MyError = require("../../../exception/MyError");
const NotFoundError = require("../../../exception/NotFoundError");
const Room = require("../../../model/room.model");
const User = require("../../../model/user/user.model");
const FeedBack = require("../../../model/user/feedback.model");
const ReportRoom = require("../../../model/user/report.model");
const Contract = require("../../../model/transaction/contract.model");
const roomValidate = require("../validate/room.validaste");
const validateAddress = require("../validate/address.validate");
const serviceApartment = require("../service/service.service");
const rentalContract = require("../blockchain/deploy/BHRentalContract");
const { compare } = require("../../../utils/object.helper");
const demandService = require("./demand.service");
const invoiceService = require("./invoice.service");

const CREATE_ROOM_FEE = 5000;

class RoomService {
    async createRoom(_id, roomInfo) {
        const userOwner = await this.verifyUserAndBalance(_id);
        const room = await this.validateAndCreateRoom(_id, roomInfo, userOwner);
        return { data: { room, roomTransaction: room.roomTransaction } };
    }

    async reOpenRoom(ownerId, roomInfo) {
        // ... reOpenRoom implementation ...
    }

    async getAllRoom(conditions = {}, pagination, projection, populate = [], sort = {}) {
        // ... getAllRoom implementation ...
    }

    async getOneRoom(roomId) {
        // ... getOneRoom implementation ...
    }

    async getRoomFeedBack(conditions = {}, pagination) {
        // ... getRoomFeedBack implementation ...
    }

    async getRoomReport(conditions = {}, pagination) {
        // ... getRoomReport implementation ...
    }

    async updateRoom(roomId, data) {
        // ... updateRoom implementation ...
    }

    async checkUpdateServiceDemand(roomId) {
        // ... checkUpdateServiceDemand implementation ...
    }

    async autoCreateInvoice(contract) {
        // ... autoCreateInvoice implementation ...
    }

    // Helper method to verify user and balance
    async verifyUserAndBalance(userId) {
        const user = await User.getById(userId);
        if (!user) throw new NotFoundError("User not found");
        if (user?.wallet.balance < CREATE_ROOM_FEE) throw new MyError("Insufficient balance to create room");
        return user;
    }

    // Helper method to validate and create a room
    async validateAndCreateRoom(_id, roomInfo, userOwner) {
        // ... validateAndCreateRoom implementation ...
    }
}

module.exports = new RoomService();

```

n this refactored version:

I've added helper methods like verifyUserAndBalance and validateAndCreateRoom to reduce complexity in createRoom.
Comments are added where the implementation is not shown, assuming you will fill these in with the existing code.
The structure is streamlined for better readability and maintainability.
Remember to adjust the refactored code to fit the specific logic and requirements of your application. This refactoring is a guideline and may need further adjustment based on your full application context.

###

To improve the performance and reliability of this JavaScript code, especially regarding blockchain interactions with Ethereum, I recommend several enhancements and refactorings:

Optimize Provider Initialization:

Instantiate the JSON provider once at the top level and reuse it across different functions to avoid creating multiple instances.
Use a shared provider object for all functions rather than creating a new provider instance in each function.
Error Handling:

Implement more robust error handling. Instead of just logging errors, you might want to throw them or handle them more gracefully depending on the context.
Retry Logic:

The retry logic in various functions is repetitive. Create a generic retry function that can be used by all other functions.
Introduce backoff strategy in retries instead of constant delay.
Code Duplication:

There is a lot of repeated code, especially in the provider initialization and retry logic. Extract these into separate functions to reduce duplication.
Handling Missing Blocks:

Introduce logic to handle cases where blocks might be missing from the local node but available in block explorers like Etherscan.
Implement a fallback mechanism to query block explorers if the local node does not return the expected block.
Asynchronous Patterns:

Use async/await consistently across all functions for better readability and error handling.
Avoid mixing Promises and async/await unnecessarily.
Function Naming and Parameters:

Some function names are not intuitive. Renaming them for better clarity would improve the readability of the code.
Standardize the order and naming of parameters across functions.
Modularize the Code:

Break down the code into smaller, more manageable modules. For example, all provider-related functions can be in one module, while contract interaction functions can be in another.
Use Environment Variables for Configuration:

Avoid hardcoding values like RPC URLs and chain IDs. Instead, use environment variables or a configuration file.
Documentation:

Add comments to explain the purpose and usage of each function, especially where the logic might not be immediately clear.
Unit Tests:

Writing unit tests for these functions can greatly help in ensuring that they work as expected and in catching bugs early.
Based on these suggestions, I will refactor the code accordingly.

Here is a refactored version of your JavaScript code incorporating the suggested improvements:
